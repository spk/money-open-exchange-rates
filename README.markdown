# Money Open Exchange Rates

A gem that calculates the exchange rate using published rates from
[open-exchange-rates](http://josscrowcroft.github.com/open-exchange-rates/)

## Usage

```ruby
require 'money/bank/open_exchange_rates_bank'
moe = Money::Bank::OpenExchangeRatesBank.new
moe.cache = 'path/to/file/cache'
moe.app_id = 'your app id from https://openexchangerates.org/signup'
moe.update_rates

# (optional)
# set the seconds after than the current rates are automatically expired
# by default, they never expire
moe.ttl_in_seconds = 86400

Money.default_bank = moe
```

You can also provide a Proc as a cache to provide your own caching mechanism
perhaps with Redis or just a thread safe `Hash` (global). For example:

```ruby
moe.cache = Proc.new do |v|
  key = 'money:exchange_rates'
  if v
    Thread.current[key] = v
  else
    Thread.current[key]
  end
end
```

## Tests

As of the end of August 2012 all requests to the Open Exchange Rates API must
have a valid app_id. You can place your own key on a file named TEST_APP_ID and
then run:

```
bundle exec rake
```
